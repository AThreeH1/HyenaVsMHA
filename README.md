# HyenaVsMHA
Experiment designed to test Hyena Hierarchy with respect to Multi-Head Attention Model. Training of Hyena is done with target set as outputs from MHA(Multi-Head Attention) at different orders to see at what parameters does the Hyena perform similar to MHA given that MHA is a quadratic time computation while Hyena is semi-quadratic.
